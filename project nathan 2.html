<h1>Important of physical health(1)</h1>
<p style="color: darkblue;">As the saying goes(HEALTH IS WEALTH) even know this saying they still push it aside,Which is not the health or even the right thing to do.Health is wealth and it was not mad a saying for saying sake.In the modern erra you see people eating and behaving in unhealthy or sometimes deadly manners,Back in the 1850's when health and safety did not exist people did all sorts of things like shark hunting withouT proper tools,Radiation testing without radiation protection.</p><p style="color: darkblue;">But that does not exclude the modern erra infact in some cases it is worse.<p style="color: darkblue;">In my opinion the only way to reduce health and safety is by is by making the warning and consequences known to some people,But as for the dum ones you just gotta let them learn from their mistakes.THANK YOU FOR READING AND GET READY FOR PART 2.
